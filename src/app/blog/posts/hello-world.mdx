## Hello World, Aditya here...

After excessive thinking on what to write, procrastinating for ages, today I decided that I'm gonna write something, doesn't matter what.

Idk much about blog writing tbh. This is sort of a training ground to learn how to write lol. So how do i start?

Let me start by my name. <i>Aditya</i> means **The Sun**, representing light, warmth and the beginning of everything. And I think the name suits me. I like my name. But people just call me by my surname because my firstname is too common T_T.

This is the 4th iteration of my website btw. My [first iteration](https://brave-roentgen-894fe6.netlify.app/) was in 2022(I think). This was when I was learning about web dev and we got 1 domain free from our college for hosting. If you visit, you can just see the amateur web dev skills and fancy images and the quote at the bottom lol.

My [second iteration](https://portfolio-aditya-miskin.netlify.app/) was in 2023, which I tried making simple yet playful. That is when I also started learning and experimenting about photography. Sadly, I sort of never completed it. My [third iteration](https://web.archive.org/web/20241113074926/http://www.adityamiskin.com/) was NICE. Clean, sharp, professional. I liked it but then I always thought something was missing. So I scrapped it, and started again from scratch. After a lot of inspiration, I finally setlled on this design.

Apart from just redoing the website repeatedly(lol), I do photography as well. This is something I'm REALLY passionate about. Probably this will require its own blog.

Speaking on blogs, these 2 guys have their own blogs and they were the ones who sort of bullied/inspired me into starting one which I'm really thankful for XD.

Go checkout their blogs: [Akshay's Blog](https://mrpista.blogspot.com/) & [Ishan's Twitter handle](https://x.com/IshanBh80963207)

I think one blog on friendships and my friends is also warranted now.

So yeah. This is all I have for you today. Finally, I want to write more. More blogs & posts about things I'm building, about life & philosophical questions, and sometimes short stories that are nothing but entertainment.

I hope you had a good time reading this. Any constructive criticism is always welcome.

Byee. Good Night 😴 (its 3:45AM over here as I'm writing this).
