Well my sister thinks, I'm clueless without her cuz she made all my school projects for the last 14 years. As I'm writing this blog, I'm starting to believe that she might be right. Tbh, she's just sitting beside me helping me with this blog post **#SisterGoals**. Anyways I'm **Aditya Miskin** and I'm here to tell my story.

### Childhood

One quirky fact about me is I'm obssessed over meaning of names. I think my name suits me well (thats what my Mom says). **Aditya** means the Sun god in Hindu mythology. My mom says they kept my name because I smiled a lot as a baby. I was born in a small town in North Karnataka. Soon after, my family shifted to Rajasthan because of my dad's transfer. One big misconception about Rajasthan is that it's a desert and there is no water. A lot of people tease me by saying this and I'm like "ðŸ¤¨???!!". I've seen more rain in Rajasthan than in Bengaluru nowadays lol. The scorching summers, cozy springs, insane rains, and freezing winters is what made Rajasthan so fun to live at.

I was a very shy kid growing up atleast compared to what I'm now or thats what I think. On a second thought, I dont think so. I was always out playing with friends from morning till night. Summers especially were the best. I remember going out in the most hottest of times to play cricket with my boys and coming back with the MOST HORRIFYING TAN EVER. Now that I'm thinking, I did a lot of things as a kid. Got in a lot of troubles and got a LOT of bruises. I almost lost my left eye, broke my right leg, got stitches on my head, burned my leg soo bad that my skin was melting ewww.... Thats a bit too extreme to show it here but TRUST ME, it wasn't a pretty sight.

I was in Rajasthan for quite some time. I think it was around 8 years. I got to know we were moving back to Karnataka at the start of my 7th class. Everything happened so suddenly that I couldn't even say proper goodbyes to my friends. It was a very sad moment for me. But like all good things, it had to end at some point. Now that we were back in Karnataka, it was time for my âœ¨Teenage Lifeâœ¨.

### Teenage Life???

When considering biorisk related to AI systems, there are two main ways in which general purpose AI capabilities could affect biological threat creation (see, e.g., Nelson and Rose, 2023(opens in a new window) and Sandbrink, 2023(opens in a new window)): increased access and increased novelty.

### The Era of COVID

### Present Day
